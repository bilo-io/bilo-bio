        text: `Where do you begin talking about Grand Theft Auto V? Do you start with the vast, varied, beautiful open world? Do you start with the innovative structure that gives you three independent protagonists you can switch between on the fly? Maybe you talk about the assortment of side activities you can engage in, or the tremendous number of ways in which you can go about making your own fun. Or perhaps you dive right into the game’s story problems, or its serious issues with women. GTA V is a complicated and fascinating game, one that fumbles here and there and has an unnecessary strain of misogynistic nastiness running through it. But it also does amazing things no other open-world game has attempted before, using multiple perspectives to put you in the thick of cinematic heist sequences and other exhilarating, multi-layered missions like no open-world game before. Those perspectives come courtesy of Michael, Franklin, and Trevor. Michael’s a former criminal who’s dissatisfied with his current life of privilege and relaxation. His marriage is on the rocks and he struggles to connect with his shallow daughter Tracey, who dreams of making it big in reality TV, and with his lazy, entitled son Jimmy, who spends most of his time spouting hate-filled trash talk while playing video games online. Franklin’s a talented young driver and repo man who doesn’t seem to have too many opportunities to move up in the world, until he has a chance meeting with Michael. Michael finds Franklin easier to connect with than his own children, and he promptly takes him under his wing and ushers him into a life of big-time crime.
        Moments of hypocrisy and inconsistency diminish the otherwise strong characters.
        And then there’s Trevor, a former friend and business associate of Michael’s who is now a methamphetamine entrepreneur living in a desert town north of Los Santos. Trevor’s a truly horrible, terrifying, psychotic human being--and a terrific character. He possesses a chilling combination of intelligence and insanity, and he’s so monstrously violent and frightening at times that he almost makes the other two protagonists seem well-adjusted by comparison. Exceptional voice acting and animation help make Trevor a character you will never, ever forget, even though you might want to.
        When circumstances reunite the long-estranged Trevor and Michael, the tensions between them complicate the entire group dynamic; Michael, Trevor and Franklin may work together, but they don’t always get along. Their dialogue is sharp and snappy and it’s usually a joy to watch them interacting with each other, but unfortunately, the characters sometimes behave in ways that don’t feel consistent. For instance, Franklin takes the moral high ground in an argument with a paparazzo, then casts his reservations aside to help him take degrading photos of a female celebrity. And when Trevor shows up in Michael’s life after an extended absence, the speed with which the two start working together again is at odds with their deep-seated reservations about each other.`,

        text: `If a motion capture actor's resume is to be believed, Grand Theft Auto 6 is well into production. Spotted by NeoGAF user chadskin, actor Tim Neff has listed motion capture work for both Red Dead Redemption 2 and the very-much-unannounced Grand Theft Auto 6 on his resume: Motion capture work is typically completed some way into game production, which could imply a setting has been chosen. However, it may also be that stock moves were captured for convenience, alongside Neff's work for RDR2.
        Given the continued world-conquering success of GTA 5, it's a no-brainer that Rockstar would be working on a follow-up, but this is the first time we've seen possible evidence that production is in progress.
        Last year, rumours circulated that the inevitable sequel was in production. Back in 2013, since-departed Rockstar president Leslie Benzies said the company had "45 years worth of ideas we want to do" with GTA.
        Joe Skrebels is IGN's UK News Editor, and Tim Neff lists "dance hip-hop" as a skill, so now he just wants a GTA / Step Up rhythm action crossover. Follow him on Twitter.`,

        text: `Thor: Ragnarok helmer Taika Waititi is reportedly in talks to direct the long-gestating, live-action remake of Akira, based on the manga and 1988 anime.
        According to Deadline, Warner Bros. is negotiating with the New Zealand-born filmmaker to helm the project, which has almost come together a few times over the years. The Hughes Brothers (The Book of Eli), Ruairi Robinson (The Last Days on Mars), and Jaume Collet-Serra (Non-Stop) were among the filmmakers who previously tried to translate Akira into live-action.
        Before Waititi, Get Out's Jordan Peele was the director most recently approached by Warner Bros. about taking on the project.
        Leonardo DiCaorio is one of the producers on the project along with his Appian Way partner Jennifer Davisson and Mad Chance's Andrew Lazar.
        No word on how far along the talks are between the studio and Waititi or when Akira might go before cameras. Deadline says Waititi's next directorial project is supposed to be the World War II dramedy Jojo Rabbit, which begins filming next spring.
        At one point in the live-action Akira's development, actors Dane DeHaan and Michael Pitt were up for the role of Tetsuo. The cast was also to have included Garrett Hedlund and Kristin Stewart, with Ken Watanabe and Helena Bonham Carter also rumored at the time for roles.
        Taika Waititi's Thor: Ragnarok hammers its way into theaters in November.`,
