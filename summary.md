### My Core
While I consider myself a well-rounded software engineer, I shine in anything related to visualisation of any sorts. This includes (but is not limited to) the following:- 2D and 3D games for mobile/desktop/console- 3D virtual reality applications (virtual site exploration & collaborative movie making). 

### My Tech
While these are technologies I worked with up to my MSc, professionally I am currently a frontend React and Angular developer. However, in the past I have worked on .NET and Node REST APIs, as well as cloud-based infrastructures like Azure and Firebase. Building software that solves real-life problems and brings joy to users is what I aspire to!

# My Goal
Since we all share this world, I firmly believe that we should all try to make it a better place to live in. Harnassing the power of technology is my approach to achieving that ridiculous, yet possible goal. Check out my profile ... or don't. Up to you. Cheers
